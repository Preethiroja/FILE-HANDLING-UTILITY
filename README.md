# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY
This Java program demonstrates a practical and fundamental application of file handling â€” a core concept in any programming language, particularly useful in scenarios involving persistent data storage. The goal of this task is to develop a simple yet effective program that allows users to interact with files by writing, reading, and modifying their contents. The Java class named task1 provides a console-based interface that guides the user through each step in a structured and user-friendly manner.
Overview
The program is structured into three main functionalities:
Writing to a file
Reading from the file
Appending new data to the file
All file operations are handled through built-in classes available in the java.io package, such as FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader. The program takes input from the user using the Scanner class (from the java.util package) and performs operations on a file named codtech_file.txt
